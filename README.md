# Netflix User Dashboard


## Project Overview
A data visualization project using Microsoft Power BI to generate a simple dashboard using Netflix user database from Kaggle.
The dashboard shows information including total users, total revenue, user by gender, subscription by device, subscription based on different countries, and total subscription by year according to type of subscription plans. The dashboard was made only by using one table.

## Data Sources
The data used for the dashboard was obtained from Kaggle, an open-source platform where we can access tons of datasets. As for this dashboard project, I will use the [Netflix Userbase Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnavsmayan/netflix-userbase-dataset).

The dataset is a sample Netflix userbase that shows the User ID, users' subscription type, the users' monthly revenue, the date they joined Netflix, Their latest payment, the users' country, age, gender, device, and the plan duration.

Below are the snippet of the data for the analysis.
