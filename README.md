# Netflix User Dashboard


## Project Overview
A data visualization project using Microsoft Power BI to generate a simple dashboard using Netflix user database from Kaggle.
The dashboard shows information including total users, total revenue, user by gender, subscription by device, subscription based on different countries, and total subscription by year according to type of subscription plans. The dashboard was made only by using one table.

## Data Sources
The data used for the dashboard was obtained from Kaggle, an open-source platform where we can access tons of datasets. As for this dashboard project, I will use the [Netflix Userbase Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnavsmayan/netflix-userbase-dataset).

The dataset is a sample Netflix userbase that shows the User ID, users' subscription type, the users' monthly revenue, the date they joined Netflix, Their latest payment, the users' country, age, gender, device, and the plan duration.

Below are the snippet of the data for the analysis.

## Tools
The tools used for this project is Microsoft Power BI. Power BI allows me to import the data from csv file into the platform. It also have a lot of features for me to view the data based on the objectives. 

As for this project, there are no issues from the data. All data are standardized according to their values and format. Hence no data cleaning need to be done for this project.

## Dashboard Overview
In this section, I will explained each and every section from the dashboard for a bettter view and description for its functions.

### Main Dashboard View

### Slicer
The slicer functions as a filter. In this project, users' joinning date is used so that we can monitor the data visualization based on join date.

### Cards
Cards is a simple visualization display. We can choose what data we want to display. Usually this visualization is used to view the overall performance, value, etc. Hence, in this dashboard, i want to monitor the total number of netflix user and also it's total reveue.

### Charts and Graphs
In this section are the most crucial parts in the project. Charts and graphs are common tools to show the data by a quick glance. It helps user to clearly monitor the performace of a data based on their trends, lines, partitions, and colours. Besides that, we can also make a quick filter by clickig the section in the charts or graphs to have a better view on its particular record.

As for gender and device, both are categorical measurement that are less tha five categories. Hence, pie chart and bar charts are the most suitable tools for this visualization purposes.

As for subscription type, stacked area graph is used in order to have a better view on its trends of subscription. We can see the trend movement by year.

### Map
Map visualization is a unique tool where we able to visualize the data based on the location. Power BI will automatically detect the location and projectorise the map and label the data in form of coloured cluster on the map.

Unfortuately, the features are only available for paid versions. Previously, the project was done offline without signing in an account. There is a issue occured where the visual only able for paid versions only.

## Conclusions
The dashboard is successfully beeing developed. Here we can have a better presentations and visualization of the data from a two dimensional table to a attractive clearer visuals. Furthermore, every analysis can be made by adjusting the filter with a single click.

## Limitations
There are limitaions faced in this project. Power BI is both free to use and also they offer paid versions as well. As we can see, there are more features are limited only for the paid versions as for example our map visualization. As for personal usage, it is still reasonable to use the free version. As a professioal or people workig in a corporate, paid version is a must because we can access more features that maybe helpful for an analysis.
